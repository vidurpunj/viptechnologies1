                            Website development refers to the work involved in creating a website. This could range from
                            developing a single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic
                            businesses, and social network services.

                            Website development can involve numerous technologies, but some of the most common include
                            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and SQL. The specific technologies used can depend
                            on whether the development is front-end (client-side), back-end (server-side), or full-stack
                            (both).

                            A static website is one that is primarily coded in HTML and displays the same information to
                            every visitor. On the other hand, a dynamic website can display different content and
                            provide user interaction, as it includes scripting in addition to HTML.
